## Assorted Vegetables: Chris Lam & Jayden Zhen
## Overview
Assorted Vegetables will be fruit ninja clones where fruit will be thrown across the screen for users to slash through with their mouse. The more fruits that are cut in a given interval of time, the higher the combo and the more points will be rewarded for their effort. The classic gamemode gives the player three lives. Upon having three fruits fall out of the screen before slashing them or slashing a bomb the game will end. The arcade gamemode does not feature lives, and instead, has a sixty second timer. The goal is to cut as many fruits as possible while avoiding the bombs in the time limit. A slashed bomb will result in a ten point penalty. The freeze banana works to halt the timer and slow the fruit. 
## Instructions
Press play in Processing!!!
You will start at a menu. Slice whichever fruit corresponds with the gamemode you wish to play. Your mouse cursor is the blade. Move your mouse over the fruits to cut them. At the end of the game you can return to the menu to play again or select the other gamemode.

##Bugs

Slicing the freeze banana sometimes leads to either a second increase in time or the time just going straight to zero. If encountered, restart the game.
